Conways Game of Life built with React - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

### Things I learned
1. Mapping through an array and producing a large number of Div's does not effect browser performance, React is fast and re-renders the virtual efficiently and only passes the changes to the browser.
2. Getting better at styling using CSS-in-JSS. Passing properties/variables to to CSS is effective.
3. Using react-transition-group for adding simple css transitions i.e Instructions page slides in.

### Challenges
1. Creating the logic of the board. Figuring out how to reference the neighbouring blocks to tally up the neighbouring block count each cycle.

###Tips:
keep at it! Consistency is key.
